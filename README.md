# x-route
bus routes

Service was developed according to KISS principle.

Assumption: all routes are bidirectional

Note: Aim of the project - demonstrate possibility store in memory all needed data,
      start service and provide response in reasonable time.
      It is still necessary to add some checks and javadocs,
      improve exception handling, logging and test coverage for production purpose.
